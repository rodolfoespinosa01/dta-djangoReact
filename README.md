# Diet Generator - Scalable AI-Powered Solution  

This project is a **special diet generator** that incorporates a **unique algorithm** not currently available on the market.  

## About the Developer  
**Created by:** Rodolfo Espinosa Nunez  
**Education:** Computer Science student at **Rutgers Newark**  

While this project is a great learning experience, it is also inspired by my past business, where I managed a team responsible for creating custom diet plans for fitness influencers and their clients. The goal is to **automate** the entire process and turn it into a **scalable, profitable** business.  

## Evolution of the Project  
- Originally built using **SQL**  
- Transitioned into **WordPress with a custom plugin**  
- Now being rebuilt using **Django (backend) & React (frontend)** for scalability and AI integration  

## Goals  
- Automate diet generation  
- Make it scalable & efficient  
- Integrate AI in the future  
- Monetize the platform
